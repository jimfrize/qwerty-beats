QWERTY-Beats is a realtime beat mashing tool made with Plugdata (https://plugdata.org)

You will need to download and install Plugdata to use this tool. Please keep QWERTY-BEATS.pd, sfpick.pd and path-list.txt in the same directory.
The main patch file is QWERTY-BEATS.pd, it is recommended that you run it in Plugdata's "Plugin Mode" so the interface is less cluttered.

To start mashing beats, you'll need to pick a directory on your system that contains a selection of audio loops in the WAV or AIFF file format.
Click on the Bang button in the top left corner of the QWERTY-Beats interface, this will open a file dialog window that will allow you to select a directory on your system.
Now you can start mashing away at the Q,W,E,R,T,Y keys on your device's keyboard to rain-down a torrent of evicerated drum beats! :)

Keys:

* Q = Toggle Playback
* W = Toggle Stutter Feedback
* E = Toggle Crush Distortion
* R = Toggle Reverse Mode
* T = Trigger Sample Randomizer
* Y = Toggle Flanger

Have Fun!!!
